## Dependencies

MyScreenShot uses SDWebImageSwiftUI and Lottie-iOS within CocoaPods.

# Building 

Downloading and building MyScreenShot is simple. Make sure you have at least Xcode 15 and Cocoapods 1.14.0 installed and are using an Apple Silicon machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/samuelcphillips/MyScreenShot.git
cd MyScreenShot
pod install
```

At this point, make sure to open the .xcworksfolder file, NOT the .xcodeproj file.
